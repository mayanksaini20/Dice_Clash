# Dice Clash üé≤

**Dice Clash** is an exciting two-player dice game designed to enhance skills in web development, especially focusing on dynamic DOM manipulation and interactive UIs. Players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points, aiming to be the first to reach 100 points. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features üìú

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Each player takes turns rolling the dice. The number rolled is added to the player's current score, but if a 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends with no points added. Players can choose to "hold" their current score and pass the turn to the next player.

- **Interactive Dice Roll**: The game offers a visually interactive dice roll mechanism, with the dice image dynamically changing according to the player's roll.

- **Score Holding**: Players can save their accumulated score and prevent losing points by rolling a 1 through the "Hold" button.

- **Winning Mechanism**: The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 100 points, and the winning player is clearly highlighted. The game can be reset anytime with the "New Game" button.

- **Smooth UI Transitions**: Visually appealing transitions when the active player changes and dynamic feedback for win/loss conditions.

## User Interface (UI)

- **Minimalist, Modern Design**: Simple and clean UI to keep the focus on gameplay. The use of a vibrant color palette and smooth animations makes the game more engaging.

- **Player Panels**: Each player has a panel displaying their current and total scores. The active player's panel is visually highlighted, making it easy to see whose turn it is.

- **Dice Image Update**: The dice image changes dynamically based on the player's roll, adding a visual element to the game.

- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive, adjusting its layout seamlessly to fit screens of all sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across mobile and desktop devices.
